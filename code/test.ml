(*radius of the earth - needed in the distance formula *)
(* note: we are using km *)
let earthrad = 6371.0 

let pi = 4. *. atan 1.

(* haversin = (sin(theta/2))^2 *)
let haversin (x:float) : float =
  (sin (x /. 2.0)) ** 2.0

(* converts lat and long pairs from degrees into radians *)

  let radians =  ( *.) (pi /. 180.0) in
  match x with

(* our spherical distance function is all based on the Haversine Formula -
